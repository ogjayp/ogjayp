# Just One More Game

**We're loss maxing.** Ok so we had a couple bad games, some not so trying games (because it's unranked of course), and then sweat dripping, controller raging, beating that makes you realize you spent 2 hours of your life, losing.

But this new Juno skin is sick right? But when did the time fly by so fast, it's now 11:28PM... and I forgot to meal prep. :(


## The Warm Up

Hopping onto the home screen after a day of working, errands, and traffic, feels like a breath of fresh air. Like it's finally time to relax, time to stop thinking about stress, time to lock-in... as much as one could do in solo unranked **LOL**. My top 2 heroes are: Soldier 76, and Junkrat (with the occasional Ana).
